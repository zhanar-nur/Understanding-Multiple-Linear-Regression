# Understanding-Multiple-Linear-Regression

## Introduction

### Goal 
This analysis will demonstrate how to quantify the relationship between three variables using a Multiple Linear Regression model. I will be using a dataset that contains three variables (mid-semester examination scores, end-semester examination scores and attendance level) in order to quantify if the mid-semester scores and the classroom attendance are good predictors for the end-semester scores.

_We use Multiple linear regression, when weâ€™d like to understand the relationship between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable._

### Motivation
This analysis is my practice to master Multiple Linear Regression as a technique to be used in Data Science field.

### Data
Predicting End Semester Performance dataset will be used for the analysis. It is public and available in Kaggle at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/akiwelekar/predictingese).

### Libraries
You need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- statsmodels
- matplotlib
- scipy

### Summary
This analysis has been performed purely for the display purposes of the Multiple Linear Regression model and demonstrated how important to make sure that all the assumptions of the model are met.
